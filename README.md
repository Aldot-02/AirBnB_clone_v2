PROJECT NAME: 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console

INSTRUCTIONS TO FOLLOW WHILE WRITING THE PYTHON SCRIPTS

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc
All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)


INSTRUCTIONS FOR TESTING PYTHON SCRIPTS

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files should end with a new line
All your test files should be inside a folder tests
You have to use the unittest module
All your test files should be python files (extension: .py)
All your test files and folders should start by test_
Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project
e.g., For models/base_model.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test_models/test_base_model.py
e.g., For models/user.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test_models/test_user.py
All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m unittest discover tests
You can also test file by file by using this command: python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base_model.py
All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case


DESCRIPTION OF THE COMMAND INTERPRETER

The command interpreter, also known as a shell, is a program that allows users to interact with the operating system by entering commands. Here's a brief description of how to start and use the command interpreter, as well as some examples:

How to start the command interpreter:

To start the command interpreter, simply open a terminal or console window on your operating system. Depending on your system, you may have different options for accessing the command interpreter. For example, on Linux or macOS, you can usually access it by opening the Terminal application. On Windows, you can access it by opening the Command Prompt or PowerShell application.

How to use the command interpreter:

Once you have started the command interpreter, you can begin entering commands. The basic syntax for a command is:
command [options] [arguments]


Here, the command is the name of the program or function you want to run, options are flags that modify the behavior of the command, and arguments are values or variables that the command needs to run.

Examples:

Here are some examples of basic commands you can run in the command interpreter:

ls: lists the contents of the current directory.
cd: changes the current directory to the specified directory.
mkdir: creates a new directory.
rm: removes a file or directory.
echo: prints text to the console.
cat: displays the contents of a file.
Here are some examples of commands with options and arguments:

ls -l: lists the contents of the current directory in long format, showing details such as permissions, owner, size, and date.
cd /path/to/directory: changes the current directory to the specified directory.
mkdir newdirectory: creates a new directory called "newdirectory" in the current directory.
rm -r directory: removes the directory called "directory" and all its contents recursively.
echo "Hello, world!": prints the text "Hello, world!" to the console.
cat myfile.txt: displays the contents of the file "myfile.txt" in the console.
Overall, the command interpreter is a powerful tool for interacting with the operating system and running various tasks and commands. With some practice and familiarity, you can become proficient in using the command interpreter to accomplish your tasks efficiently.
